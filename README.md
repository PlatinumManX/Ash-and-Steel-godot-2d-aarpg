# Ash-and-Steel-godot-2d-aarpg
Ash and Steel is a 2D action RPG developed in Godot, inspired by classic exploration-driven games. The project is designed around a modular finite state machine architecture to support player movement, AI-driven enemies, world exploration, and future systems such as combat abilities and dialogue-based interactions.
